This code attempts to use a session variable before it's been started.  In PHP, sessions must be explicitly started using `session_start()` before accessing session variables.  If `session_start()` isn't called, accessing `$_SESSION['counter']` will result in an undefined index error or unexpected behavior.

```php
<?php
// Incorrect: Accessing session variable before starting the session
echo $_SESSION['counter'];

// ... more code ...
?>
```
